 - **FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine):** Integrated with IPFS, FVM provides smart contract functionality to automate data storage and management processes, offering economic incentives for data storage.
 - **Data Preservation:** Decentralized storage minimizes the risk of data loss and maintains immutable data records combined with blockchain technology.
 - **Content Accessibility:** Users can find and utilize other content directly within the Filtion platform, eliminating the need to rely on external sites.

**2. AI Image Generation (Lilypad)**
 - **Lilypad:** A tool that allows users to generate the images they need using AI, enriching their content.
 - **Image Utilization:** Users can freely use the generated images on their websites or content spaces.

**3. ENS Domain Usage**
 - **ENS (Ethereum Name Service):** A blockchain-based domain name system that allows users to own unique domain names.
 - **Domain Management:** Users can own their own domains, creating personalized website addresses.
 - **Sharing and Accessibility:** Users can easily share their content with others through their owned domains.
